STEP 2: GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR HOUSE COMMITTEES
================================================================================
Extract committees, subcommittees, member information, and staff information from this text into JSON format.
                    Be thorough in extracting all relevant information (don't miss any names).
                    For each committee:
                    1. Find the committee name
                    2. IMPORTANT: First process the main committee members and staff (all members and staff listed BEFORE any subcommittee section)
                    - Create a subcommittee with the same name as the committee
                    - Include all members and staff listed at the start of the committee section

                    STAFF PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS:
                    - Look for major staff sections marked by 'STAFF', 'Majority Staff', 'Minority Staff', or similar headers
                    - Process ALL staff hierarchically - Director level, Deputy level, Professional Staff, Administrative Staff, etc.
                    - Pay special attention to indented staff listings which indicate reporting relationships
                    - Look for staff listings in office-specific sections (e.g., "Clerk's Office:", "Communications:", etc.)
                    - Process ALL contact information sections as they often contain additional staff listings
                    - Watch for staff sections that continue across multiple pages

                    For lines with two-column formats:
                    * Process both the left and right sides of the line
                    * Look for names separated by multiple spaces or tabs
                    * Each side typically ends with a state and period

                    For names that are split across lines with state information:
                    * Check for entries where the state appears indented on the next line
                    * Combine name and state information even when split by line breaks

                    3. Then process any subcommittee section if it exists
                    4. For committees with NO subcommittees, use the committee name as the subcommittee name
                    5. Include everything until the next committee name appears
                    6. After processing main sections, check for:
                    - Additional staff listings at the end of committee sections
                    - Staff listings in footnotes or supplementary sections
                    - Professional staff members listed under special sections


                    For each committee/subcommittee, record:
                    - Members and their roles (Chair, Vice Chair, etc., use 'Member' if no explicit role listed)
                    - States for members (use 'N/A' if no state listed)
                    - Staff (names listed under 'STAFF' sections) and their roles (use 'Staff' if no explicit role listed)
                    - States for staff (use 'N/A' if no state listed)

                    Important details:
                    - Include each name in every committee/subcommittee they appear in
                    - Process BOTH columns when lines are formatted in two columns
                    - Look for multiple names per line (separated by commas, periods, or large spaces)
                    - Check if entries continue on next line
                    - Keep line indentation in mind when grouping information
                    - Remember that the main committee members and staff come BEFORE any subcommittee listings
                    - For two-column layouts, process right column with same care as left column
                    - DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE THE STAFF, most committees/subcommittees have staff listed under 'STAFF' sections

STEP 2: GPT PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR DIPLOMATIC OFFICES
================================================================================
Extract diplomatic office information and representatives from this text into JSON format. Be thorough in extracting all relevant information (don't miss any names). For each diplomatic office:

                    1. Find the diplomatic office name (in ALL CAPS, e.g., "AFGHANISTAN", "ALBANIA", etc.)

                    2. For each diplomatic office section:
                    - Process everything until the next ALL CAPS office name appears
                    - Watch for office sections that continue across multiple pages

                    3. For each diplomatic office, extract:
                    - Primary representatives with official titles like:
                        * Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
                        * Chargé d'Affaires
                        * Minister
                        * Counselor
                        * First Secretary
                    - Look for standard prefixes/honorifics:
                        * His Excellency
                        * Her Excellency
                        * Mr.
                        * Ms.
                        * Dr.

                    4. Name processing rules:
                    - Look for names following honorifics
                    - Process both given names and surnames
                    - Handle compound names and special characters (accents, hyphens, etc.)
                    - Watch for names that may be split across lines
                    - Include middle names/initials when present

                    5. Role processing rules:
                    - Capture the complete official title
                    - If no explicit role is listed, use 'N/A'
                    - Include acting or temporary roles (e.g., "Chargé d'Affaires ad interim")
                    - Preserve the full diplomatic rank when provided

                    6. Country processing rules:
                    - Record the country associated with each representative
                    - Use the country name in ALL CAPS
                    - If the role isn't specific to a country, use 'N/A'

                    7. Special attention areas:
                    - Check for transitional or temporary appointments
                    - Watch for "Vacant" positions (if name is not provided just don't include the entry)
                    - Process names in consular office sections if they appear
                    - Handle cases where multiple representatives are listed (should each be a separate entry)
                    - Note when positions are filled by the same person (should each be a separate entry)

                    Important details:
                    - EVERY name that appears in the text must be included in the JSON
                    - Each diplomatic representative should be linked to their office
                    - Process ALL names even if they appear in subsidiary sections
                    - Maintain the connection between names and their diplomatic office
                    - Don't skip names just because they're in consular office sections
                    - Handle special cases like "protecting powers" listings at the end
                    - Check for continuation of titles/roles after page breaks
                    - Verify complete extraction when content spans page boundaries
                    - Process non-country diplomatic offices (e.g., African Union, European Union)

                    Output the results in the existing JSON structure provided.
