                                FOREWORD

    The Congressional Directory is one of the oldest working handbooks 
in the United States government. While there have been directories of 
one form or another since the First Congress of the United States 
convened in 1789, the Congressional Directory for the first session of 
the 30th Congress (1847) is considered by scholars and historians to be 
the first official edition because it was the first to be ordered and 
paid for by the Congress. With the addition of biographical sketches of 
legislators in 1867, the Congressional Directory attained its modern 
format.

    The Congressional Directory is published by the United States Senate 
in partnership with the Government Printing Office, at the direction of 
the Joint Committee on Printing under the authority of Title 44, Section 
721 of the U.S. Code.
