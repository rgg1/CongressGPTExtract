    Note: The original apportionment of Representatives was assigned in 
1787 in the Constitution and remained in effect for the 1st and 2d 
Congresses. Subsequent apportionments based on the censuses over the 
years have been figured using several different methods approved by 
Congress, all with the goal of dividing representation among the states 
as equally as possible. After each census up to and including the 
Thirteenth in 1910, Congress would enact a law designating the specific 
changes in the actual number of Representatives as well as the increase 
in the ratio of persons-per-Representative. After having made no 
apportionment after the Fourteenth census in 1920, Congress by statute 
in 1929 fixed the total number of Representatives at 435 (the number 
attained with the apportionment after the 1910 census), and since that 
time, only the ratio of persons-per-Representative has continued to 
increase, in fact, significantly so. Since the total is now fixed, the 
specific number of Representatives per state is adjusted after each 
census to reflect its percentage of the entire population. Since the 
Sixteenth Census in 1940, the ``equal proportions'' method of 
apportioning Representatives within the 435 total has been employed. A 
detailed explanation of the entire apportionment process can be found in 
The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts, 1789-
1983. Kenneth C. Martis, The Free Press, New York, 1982.
    \1\ No apportionment was made after the 1920 census.
    \2\ The following Representatives were added after the indicated 
apportionments when these states were admitted in the years listed. The 
number of these additonal Representatives for each state remained in 
effect until the next census's apportionment (with the exceptions of 
California and New Mexico, as explained in footnote 4). They are not 
included in the total for each column. In reading this table, please 
remember that the apportionments made after each census took effect with 
the election two years after the census date. As a result, in the table 
footnote 2 is placed for several states under the decade preceding the 
one in which it entered the Union, since the previous decade's 
apportionment was still in effect at the time of statehood.

(1816), 1; Mississippi (1817), 1; Illinois (1818), 1; Alabama (1819), 1; 
Missouri (1821), 1; Fifth: Arkansas (1836), 1; Michigan (1837), 1;

    \3\ When Alaska and then Hawaii joined the Union in 1959, the law 
was changed to allow the total membership of the House of 
Representatives to increase to 436 and then to 437, apportioning one new 
Representative for each of those states. The total returned to 435 in 
1963, when the 1960 census apportionment took effect.

    \4\ Even though the respective censuses were taken before the 
following states joined the Union, Representatives for them were 
apportioned either because of anticipation of statehood or because they 
had become states in the period between the census and the 
apportionment, hence they are included in the totals of the respective 
columns. First: Vermont (1791); Kentucky (1792); Fourth: Missouri 
(1821); Seventh: California (1850); Eighth: Kansas (1861); Thirteenth: 
New Mexico (1912); Arizona (1912). (Please note: These seven states are 
also included in footnote 2 because they became states while the 
previous decade's apportionment was still in effect for the House of 
Representatives.) California's situation was unusual. It was scheduled 
for inclusion in the figures for the 1850 census apportionment; however, 
when the apportionment law was passed in 1852, California's census 
returns were still incomplete so Congress made special provision that 
the state would retain ``the number of Representatives [two] prescribed 
by the act of admission * * * into the Union until a new apportionment 
[i.e., after the 1860 census]'' would be made. The number of 
Representatives from California actually increased before the next 
apportionment to three when Congress gave the state an extra 
Representative during part of the 37th Congress, from 1862 to 1863. 
Regarding New Mexico, the 1911 apportionment law, passed by the 62d 
Congress in response to the 1910 census and effective with the 63d 
Congress in 1913, stated that ``if the Territor[y] of * * * New Mexico 
shall become [a State] in the Union before the apportionment of 
Representatives under the next decennial census [it] shall have one 
Representative * * *.'' When New Mexico became a state in 1912 during 
the 62d Congress, it was given two Representatives. The number was 
decreased to one beginning the next year in the 63d.
    \5\ The ``Maine District'' of Massachusetts became a separate state 
during the term of the 16th Congress, in 1820. For the remainder of that 
Congress, Maine was assigned one ``at large'' Representative while 
Massachusetts continued to have 20 Representatives, the number 
apportioned to it after the 1810 census. For the 17th Congress (the last 
before the 1820 census apportionment took effect), seven of 
Massachusetts's Representatives were reassigned to Maine, leaving 
Massachusetts with 13.
    \6\ Of the 11 Representatives apportioned to Virginia after the 1860 
census, three were reassigned to West Virginia when that part of 
Virginia became a separate state in 1863. Since the Virginia seats in 
the House were vacant at that time because of the Civil War, all of the 
new Representatives from West Virginia were able to take their seats at 
once. When Representatives from Virginia reentered the House in 1870, 
only eight members represented it.
