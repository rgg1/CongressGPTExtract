                                FOREWORD

    The Congressional Directory is one of the oldest working handbooks 
within the United States Government. While there were unofficial 
directories for Congress in one form or another beginning with the 1st 
Congress in 1789, the Congressional Directory published in 1847 for the 
30th Congress is considered by scholars and historians to be the first 
official edition because it was the first to be ordered and paid for by 
Congress. With the addition of biographical sketches of legislators in 
1867, the Congressional Directory attained its modern format.

    The Congressional Directory is published by the United States 
Congress in partnership with the Government Printing Office, at the 
direction of the Joint Committee on Printing under the authority of 
Title 44, Section 721 of the U.S. Code.
