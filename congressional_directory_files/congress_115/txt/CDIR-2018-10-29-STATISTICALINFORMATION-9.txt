\1\ Closing date for this table was July 27, 2018.
\2\ The oath of office was administered to George Washington outside on the gallery in front of the Senate
  Chamber, after which the Congress and the President returned to the chamber to hear the inaugural address.
  They then proceeded to St. Paul's Chapel for the ``divine service'' performed by the Chaplain of the Congress.
  Adjournment of the ceremony did not occur until the Congress returned to Federal Hall.

[[Page 564]]

 
\3\ Funeral oration was delivered at the German Lutheran Church in Philadelphia.
\4\ Because of a tie in the electoral vote between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the House of Representatives
  had to decide the election. Thirty-six ballots were required to break the deadlock, with Jefferson's election
  as President and Burr's as Vice President on February 17. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution
  to prevent the 1800 problem from recurring.
\5\ During most of the period while the Capitol was being reconstructed following the fire of 1814, the Congress
  met in the ``Brick Capitol,'' constructed on the site of the present Supreme Court building. This joint
  session took place in the Representatives' chamber on the 2d floor of the building.
\6\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved because the House and Senate disagreed on
  Missouri's status regarding statehood. The joint session was reconvened the same day and Missouri's votes were
  counted.
\7\ While this occasion has historically been referred to as the first joint meeting of Congress, the Journals
  of the House and Senate indicate that Lafayette actually addressed the House of Representatives, with some of
  the Senators present as guests of the House (having been invited at the last minute to attend). Similar
  occasions, when members of the one body were invited as guests of the other, include the Senate address by
  Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on Aug. 6, 1942, and the House address by General H. Norman Schwarzkopf on
  May 8, 1991.
\8\ Although Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by a substantial amount and had the highest number of electoral
  votes from among the several candidates, he did not receive the required majority of the electoral votes. The
  responsibility for choosing the new President therefore devolved upon the House of Representatives. As soon as
  the Senators left the chamber, the balloting proceeded, and John Quincy Adams was elected on the first ballot.
\9\ The ceremony was moved outside to accommodate the extraordinarily large crowd of people who had come to
  Washington to see the inauguration.
\10\ The ceremony was moved inside because of cold weather.
\11\ Following the death of President Zachary Taylor, Vice President Millard Fillmore took the Presidential oath
  of office in a special joint session in the Hall of the House.
\12\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved three times so that the House and Senate could
  resolve several electoral disputes.
\13\ Because of a severe cold and hoarseness, the King could not deliver his speech, which was read by former
  Representative Elisha Hunt Allen, then serving as Chancellor and Chief Justice of the Hawaiian Islands.
\14\ The contested election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden created a constitutional crisis.
  Tilden won the popular vote by a close margin, but disputes concerning the electoral vote returns from four
  states deadlocked the proceedings of the joint session. Anticipating this development, the Congress had
  created a special commission of five Senators, five Representatives, and five Supreme Court Justices to
  resolve such disputes. The Commission met in the Supreme Court Chamber (the present Old Senate Chamber) as
  each problem arose. In each case, the Commission accepted the Hayes electors, securing his election by one
  electoral vote. The joint session was convened on 15 occasions, with the last on March 2, just three days
  before the inauguration.
\15\ The speech was written by former Speaker and Senator Robert C. Winthrop, who could not attend the ceremony
  because of ill health.
\16\ Because of a blizzard, the ceremony was moved inside, where it was held as part of the Senate's special
  session. President William Howard Taft took the oath of office and gave his inaugural address after Vice
  President James S. Sherman's inaugural address and the swearing-in of the new senators.
\17\ Held in the Senate Chamber.
\18\ Bakhmetieff represented the provisional government of Russia set up after the overthrow of the monarchy in
  March 1917 and recognized by the United States. The Bolsheviks took over in November 1917.
\19\ The address and reception were in conjunction with the presentation to the Senate by France of two Sevres
  vases in appreciation of the United States' involvement in World War I. The vases are today in the Senate
  lobby, just off the Senate floor. Two additional Sevres vases were given without ceremony to the House of
  Representatives, which today are in the Rayburn Room, not far from the floor of the House.
\20\ Senators later objected to President Harding's speech (given with no advance notice to most of the
  Senators) as an unconstitutional effort to interfere with the deliberations of the Senate, and Harding did not
  repeat visits of this kind.
\21\ This was the first Annual Message broadcast live on radio.
\22\ This was the first inauguration held pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, which changed the date from March
  4 to January 20. The Vice Presidential oath, which previously had been given earlier on the same day in the
  Senate Chamber, was added to the inaugural ceremony as well, but the Vice Presidential inaugural address was
  discontinued.
\23\ A joint reception for the King and Queen of the United Kingdom was held in the Rotunda, authorized by
  Senate Concurrent Resolution 17, 76th Congress. Although the concurrent resolution was structured to establish
  a joint meeting, the Senate, in fact, adjourned rather than recessed as called for by the resolution.
\24\ Held in the Senate Chamber.
\25\ At this time, the Philippines was still a possession of the United States, although it had been made a self-
  governing commonwealth in 1935, in preparation for full independence in 1946. From 1909 to 1916, Quezon had
  served in the U.S. House of Representatives as the resident commissioner from the Philippines.
\26\ In exile.
\27\ For this Senate Address by Queen Wilhelmina, the members of the House of Representatives were invited as
  guests. This occasion has sometimes been mistakenly referred to as a joint meeting.
\28\ The oaths of office were taken in simple ceremonies at the White House because the expense and festivity of
  a Capitol ceremony were thought inappropriate because of the war. The Joint Committee on Arrangements of the
  Congress was in charge, however, and both the Senate and the House of Representatives were present.
\29\ This was the first time the term ``State of the Union Address'' was used for the President's Annual
  Message. Also, it was the first time the address was shown live on television.
\30\ This was an informal meeting in the Coolidge Auditorium of the Library of Congress.
\31\ Presentation of new ivory gavel to the Senate.
\32\ According to the Congressional Record, the Senate adjourned prior to the inaugural ceremonies, even though
  the previously adopted resolution had stated the adjournment would come immediately following the
  inauguration. The Senate Journal records the adjournment as called for in the resolution, hence this listing
  as a joint session.
\33\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved so that the House and Senate could each resolve
  the dispute regarding a ballot from North Carolina. The joint session was reconvened the same day and the
  North Carolina vote was counted.
\34\ Rockefeller was sworn in as Vice President by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, after which, by unanimous
  consent, he was allowed to address the Senate.
\35\ Because the Governor had laryngitis, his speech was read by his wife, Pamela.
\36\ The ceremony was moved inside because of extremely cold weather.
\37\ These commemorative addresses were given in the Old Senate Chamber during a regular legislative session.
\38\ For this House Address by General Schwarzkopf, the members of the Senate were invited as guests.
\39\ This speech was mislabeled in many sources as a State of the Union Address.
\40\ President Kim Yong-sam was in Washington for the dedication of the Korean Veterans' Memorial, held the day
  after this joint meeting.
\41\ This was the first State of the Union Address carried live on the Internet.
\42\ Prime Minister Howard was originally scheduled to address a joint meeting on September 12, 2001, but
  because of the attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, the event was postponed until this occasion.
\43\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved so that the House and Senate could each discuss
  the dispute regarding the ballots from Ohio. The joint session was reconvened the same day and the Ohio votes
  were counted.

    The original apportionment of Representatives was assigned in 1787 
in the Constitution and remained in effect for the 1st and 2d 
Congresses. Subsequent apportionments based on the censuses over the 
years have been figured using several different methods approved by 
Congress, all with the goal of dividing representation among the states 
as equally as possible. After each census up to and including the 
thirteenth in 1910, Congress would enact a law designating the specific 
changes in the actual number of Representatives as well as the increase 
in the ratio of persons-per-Representative. After having made no 
apportionment after the Fourteenth census in 1920, Congress by statute 
in 1929 fixed the total number of Representatives at 435 (the number 
attained with the apportionment after the 1910 census), and since that 
time, only the ratio of persons-per-Representative has continued to 
increase, in fact, significantly so. Since the total is now fixed, the 
specific number of Representatives per state is adjusted after each 
census to reflect its percentage of the entire population. Since the 
Sixteenth Census in 1940, the ``equal proportions'' method of 
apportioning Representatives within the 435 total has been employed. A 
detailed explanation of the entire apportionment process can be found in 
The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts, 1789-
1983. Kenneth C. Martis, The Free Press, New York, 1982.

[[Page 566]]

    \1\ No apportionment was made after the 1920 census.
    \2\ The following Representatives were added after the indicated 
apportionments when these states were admitted in the years listed. The 
number of these additional Representatives for each state remained in 
effect until the next census's apportionment (with the exceptions of 
California and New Mexico, as explained in footnote 4). They are not 
included in the total for each column. In reading this table, please 
remember that the apportionments made after each census took effect with 
the election two years after the census date. As a result, in the table 
footnote 2 is placed for several states under the decade preceding the 
one in which it entered the Union, since the previous decade's 
apportionment was still in effect at the time of statehood. 
Constitutional: Vermont (1791), 2; Kentucky (1792), 2; First: Tennessee 
(1796), 1; Second: Ohio (1803), 1; Third: Louisiana (1812), 1; Indiana 
(1816), 1; Mississippi (1817), 1; Illinois (1818), 1; Alabama (1819), 1; 
Missouri (1821), 1; Fifth: Arkansas (1836), 1; Michigan (1837), 1; 
Sixth: Florida (1845), 1; Texas (1845), 2; Iowa (1846), 2; Wisconsin 
(1848), 2; California (1850), 2; Seventh: Minnesota (1858), 2; Oregon 
(1859), 1; Kansas (1861), 1; Eighth: Nevada (1864), 1; Nebraska (1867), 
1; Ninth: Colorado (1876), 1; Tenth: North Dakota (1889), 1; South 
Dakota (1889), 2; Montana (1889), 1; Washington (1889), 1; Idaho (1890), 
1; Wyoming (1890), 1; Eleventh: Utah (1896), 1; Twelth: Oklahoma (1907), 
5; New Mexico (1912), 2; Arizona (1912), 1; Seventeenth: Alaska (1959), 
1; Hawaii (1959), 1.
    \3\ When Alaska and then Hawaii joined the Union in 1959, the law 
was changed to allow the total membership of the House of 
Representatives to increase to 436 and then to 437, apportioning one new 
Representative for each of those states. The total returned to 435 in 
1963, when the 1960 census apportionment took effect.
    \4\ Even though the respective censuses were taken before the 
following states joined the Union, Representatives for them were 
apportioned either because of anticipation of statehood or because they 
had become states in the period between the census and the 
apportionment, hence they are included in the totals of the respective 
columns. First: Vermont (1791); Kentucky (1792); Fourth: Missouri 
(1821); Seventh: California (1850); Eighth: Kansas (1861); Thirteenth: 
New Mexico (1912); Arizona (1912). (Please note: These seven states are 
also included in footnote 2 because they became states while the 
previous decade's apportionment was still in effect for the House of 
Representatives.) California's situation was unusual. It was scheduled 
for inclusion in the figures for the 1850 census apportionment; however, 
when the apportionment law was passed in 1852, California's census 
returns were still incomplete so Congress made special provision that 
the state would retain ``the number of Representatives [two] prescribed 
by the act of admission * * * into the Union until a new apportionment 
[i.e., after the 1860 census]'' would be made. The number of 
Representatives from California actually increased before the next 
apportionment to three when Congress gave the state an extra 
Representative during part of the 37th Congress, from 1862 to 1863. 
Regarding New Mexico, the 1911 apportionment law, passed by the 62d 
Congress in response to the 1910 census and effective with the 63d 
Congress in 1913, stated that ``if the Territor[y] of * * * New Mexico 
shall become [a State] in the Union before the apportionment of 
Representatives under the next decennial census [it] shall have one 
Representative * * *.'' When New Mexico became a state in 1912 during 
the 62d Congress, it was given two Representatives. The number was 
decreased to one beginning the next year in the 63d.
    \5\ The ``Maine District'' of Massachusetts became a separate state 
during the term of the 16th Congress, in 1820. For the remainder of that 
Congress, Maine was assigned one ``at large'' Representative while 
Massachusetts continued to have 20 Representatives, the number 
apportioned to it after the 1810 census. For the 17th Congress (the last 
before the 1820 census apportionment took effect), seven of 
Massachusetts's Representatives were reassigned to Maine, leaving 
Massachusetts with 13.
    \6\ Of the 11 Representatives apportioned to Virginia after the 1860 
census, three were reassigned to West Virginia when that part of 
Virginia became a separate state in 1863. Since the Virginia seats in 
the House were vacant at that time because of the Civil War, all of the 
new Representatives from West Virginia were able to take their seats at 
once. When Representatives from Virginia reentered the House in 1870, 
only eight members represented it.
