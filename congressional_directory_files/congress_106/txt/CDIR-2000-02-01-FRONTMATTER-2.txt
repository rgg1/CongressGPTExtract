    The Congressional Directory is one of the oldest working handbooks 
in the United States government. While there have been directories of 
one form or another since the first Congress of the United States in 
1789, the Congressional Directory for the first session of the 30th 
Congress (1847) is considered by scholars and historians to be the first 
official edition because it is the first to be ordered and paid for by 
the Congress. With the addition of biographical sketches of legislators 
in 1867, the Congressional Directory attained its modern format.

    The Congressional Directory is published by the United States Senate 
in partnership with the Government Printing Office, at the direction of 
the Joint Committee on Printing under the authority of Title 44, Section 
721 of the U.S. Code.
