            JOINT SESSIONS, JOINT MEETINGS, AND INAUGURATIONS

                   1st-105th CONGRESSES, 1789-1997 \1\

      The parliamentary difference between a joint session and a joint 
meeting has evolved over time. In recent years the distinctions have 
become clearer: a joint session is more formal, and occurs upon the 
adoption of a concurrent resolution; a joint meeting occurs when each 
body adopts a unanimous consent agreement to recess to meet with the 
other legislative body.
      The Speaker of the House of Representatives usually presides over 
joint sessions and joint meetings; however, the President of the Senate 
does preside over counts of the electoral votes, as required by the 
Constitution.
      In the earliest years of the Republic, 1789 and 1790, when the 
national legislature met in New York City, joint gatherings were held in 
the Senate Chamber in Federal Hall. In Philadelphia, when the 
legislature met in Congress Hall, such meetings were held in the Senate 
Chamber, 1790-1793, and in the Hall of the House of Representatives, 
1794-1799. Once the Congress moved to the Capitol in Washington in 1800, 
the Senate Chamber again was used for joint gatherings through 1805. 
Since 1809, with few exceptions, joint sessions and joint meetings have 
occurred in the Hall of the House.
      Presidential messages on the state of the Union were once known as 
``Annual Messages,'' but since the 80th Congress have been called 
``State of the Union Addresses.'' After President Adams' Annual Message 
on November 22, 1800, these addresses were read by clerks to the 
individual bodies until President Wilson resumed the practice of 
delivering them to joint sessions on December 2, 1913.
      In some instances more than one joint gathering has occurred on 
the same day. For example, on January 6, 1941, Congress met in joint 
session to count electoral votes for President and Vice President, and 
then met again in joint session to receive President Roosevelt's Annual 
Message.
      Congress has hosted inaugurations since the first occasion in 
1789. They always have been formal joint gatherings, and sometimes they 
also were joint sessions. Inaugurations were joint sessions when both 
houses of Congress were in session, and they processed to the ceremony 
as part of the business of the day. In many cases, however, one or both 
houses were not in session or were in recess at the time of the 
ceremony. In the table below, inaugurations that were not joint sessions 
are listed in the second column. Those that were joint sessions are so 
identified and described in the third column.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Closing date for this table was May 12, 1997.                                                               
\2\ The oath of office was administered to George Washington outside on the gallery in front of the Senate      
  Chamber, after which the Congress and the President returned to the chamber to hear the inaugural address.    
  They then proceeded to St. Paul's Chapel for the ``divine service'' performed by the Chaplain of the Congress.
  Adjournment of the ceremony did not occur until the Congress returned to Federal Hall.                        
\3\ Funeral oration was delivered at the German Lutheran Church in Philadelphia.                                
\4\ Because of a tie in the electoral vote between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the House of Representatives
  had to decide the election. Thirty-six ballots were required to break the deadlock, with Jefferson's election 
  as President and Burr's as Vice President on February 17. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution 
  to prevent the 1800 problem from recurring.                                                                   
\5\ During most of the period while the Capitol was being reconstructed following the fire of 1814, the Congress
  met in the ``Brick Capitol,'' constructed on the site of the present Supreme Court building. This joint       
  session took place in the Representatives' chamber on the 2d floor of the building.                           
\6\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved because the House and Senate disagreed on          
  Missouri's status regarding statehood. The joint session was reconvened the same day and Missouri's votes were
  counted.                                                                                                      
\7\ While this occasion has historically been referred to as the first joint meeting of Congress, the Journals  
  of the House and of the Senate indicate that Lafayette actually addressed the House of Representatives, with  
  some of the Senators present as guests of the House. Similar occasions, when members of the one body were     
  invited as guests of the other, include the Senate address by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on Aug. 6,  
  1942, and the House address by General H. Norman Schwarzkopf on May 8, 1991.                                  
\8\ Although Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by a substantial amount and had the highest number of electoral
  votes from among the several candidates, he did not receive the required majority of the electoral votes. The 
  responsibility for choosing the new President therefore devolved upon the House of Representatives. As soon as
  the Senators left the chamber, the balloting proceeded, and John Quincy Adams was elected on the first ballot.
\9\ The ceremony was moved outside to accommodate the extraordinarily large crowd of people who had come to     
  Washington to see the inauguration.                                                                           
\10\ The ceremony was moved inside because of cold weather.                                                     
\11\ Following the death of President Zachary Taylor, Vice President Millard Fillmore took the presidential oath
  of office in a special joint session in the Hall of the House.

\12\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved three times so that the House and Senate could    
  resolve several electoral disputes.                                                                           
\13\ Because of a severe cold and hoarseness, the King could not deliver his speech, which was read by former   
  Representative Elisha Hunt Allen, then serving as Chancellor and Chief Justice of the Hawaiian Islands.       
\14\ The contested election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden created a constitutional crisis.   
  Tilden won the popular vote by a close margin, but disputes concerning the electoral vote returns from four   
  states deadlocked the proceedings of the joint session. Anticipating this development, the Congress had       
  created a special commission of five Senators, five Representatives, and five Supreme Court Justices to       
  resolve such disputes. The Commission met in the Supreme Court Chamber (the present Old Senate Chamber) as    
  each problem arose. In each case, the Commission accepted the Hayes' electors, securing his election by one   
  electoral vote. The joint session was convened on 15 occasions, with the last on March 2, just three days     
  before the inauguration.                                                                                      
\15\ The speech was written by former Speaker and Senator Robert C. Winthrop, who could not attend the ceremony 
  because of ill health.                                                                                        
\16\ Because of a blizzard, the ceremony was moved inside, where it was held as part of the Senate's special    
  session. President William Howard Taft took the oath of office and gave his inaugural address after Vice      
  President James S. Sherman's inaugural address and the swearing-in of the new senators.                       
\17\ Held in the Senate Chamber.                                                                                
\18\ This was the first Annual Message broadcast live on radio.                                                 
\19\This was the first inauguration held pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, which changed the date from March 
  4 to January 20. The Vice Presidential oath, which previously had been given earlier on the same day in the   
  Senate Chamber, was added to the inaugural ceremony as well, but the Vice Presidential inaugural address was  
  discontinued.                                                                                                 
\20\ A joint reception for the King and Queen of the United Kingdom was held in the Rotunda, authorized by      
  Senate Concurrent Resolution 17, 76th Congress. Although the concurrent resolution was structured to establish
  a joint meeting, the Senate, in fact, adjourned rather than recessed as called for by the resolution.         
\21\ Delivered in the Senate Chamber.                                                                           
\22\ The oaths of office were taken in simple ceremonies at the White House because the expense and festivity of
  a Capitol ceremony were thought inappropriate because of the war. The Joint Committee on Arrangements of the  
  Congress was in charge, however, and both the Senate and the House of Representatives were present.           
\23\ This was the first time the term ``State of the Union Address'' was used for the President's Annual        
  Message. Also, it was the first time the address was shown live on television.                                
\24\ An informal meeting in the Coolidge Auditorium of the Library of Congress.                                 
\25\ According to the Congressional Record, the Senate adjourned prior to the inaugural ceremonies, even though 
  the previously adopted resolution had stated the adjournment would come immediately following the             
  inauguration. The Senate Journal records the adjournment as called for in the resolution, hence this listing  
  as a joint session.                                                                                           
\26\ The joint session to count electoral votes was dissolved so that the House and Senate could resolve the    
  dispute regarding a ballot from North Carolina. The joint session was reconvened the same day and the North   
  Carolina vote was counted.                                                                                    
\27\ Because the Governor had laryngitis, his speech was read by his wife, Pamela.                              
\28\ The ceremony was moved inside because of extremely cold weather.                                           
\29\ This speech was mislabeled in many sources as a State of the Union Address.                                
\30\ President Kim Yong-sam was in Washington for the dedication of the Korean Veterans' Memorial, held the day 
  after this joint meeting.                                                                                     
\31\ This was the first State of the Union Address carried live on the Internet.
