                     SPECIAL SESSIONS OF THE SENATE

      From 1789 to 1933 presidential and congressional terms began on 
March 4, although the Congress generally did not meet until the first 
Monday in December. When a new President was to take office, his 
predecessor would call the Senate into special session to confirm the 
nominations for the Cabinet and other significant posts. Special 
sessions also were convened to consider the ratification of treaties. 
Incumbent presidents also called special sessions from time to time to 
allow Senators to consider vacancies and other executive business. 
Special sessions are called by presidential proclamation.

         [Except as noted below, all special sessions were convened to consider executive nominations.]
