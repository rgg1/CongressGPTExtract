                             ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    The Joint Committee on Printing acknowledges with gratitude the 
commitment and dedication of the employees of the Government Printing 
Office who compiled and published this directory. Led by Ms. Kathryn 
McConnell, Project Manager, a team of eight writer-editors and keyboard 
specialists undertook this mammoth initiative, completing it in just 
five months. The members of the team included Senior Writer-Editor 
Lorena Beauchesne, Writer-Editors Joyce Carlton and Selene Dalecky, and 
Keyboard Specialists Audrey Brown, C.C. Price, Sherian K. Roberts and 
Dana Zimmerman who suffered a stroke during the project, but through her 
determination and dedication, recovered and returned to complete her 
work. Volunteering his time to assist with project research was Peter 
Byrd, an employee of the Capitol Guide Service.

    Along with these individuals, other employees of the Government 
Printing Office, including Janice Sterling, who designed the cover, and 
Jerry Fairbanks, Jack Fulmer, Mike Glaser, Bob Keller, Ben Lopez, Rick 
McElroy, Stephen Naumann and Dave Turney, who maintained graphic systems 
development, contributed to this publication. Bernie Horn served as the 
Congressional Printing Management Liaison.
