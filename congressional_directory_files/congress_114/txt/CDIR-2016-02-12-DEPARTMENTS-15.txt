    JEH CHARLES JOHNSON, Secretary of Homeland Security was sworn in on 
December 23, 2013 as the fourth Secretary of Homeland Security. Prior to 
joining DHS, Secretary Johnson served as General Counsel for the 
Department of Defense, where he was part of the senior management team 
and led the more than 10,000 military and civilian lawyers across the 
Department. As General Counsel of the Defense Department, Secretary 
Johnson oversaw the development of the legal aspects of many of our 
nation's counterterrorism policies, spearheaded reforms to the military 
commissions system at Guantanamo Bay in 2009, and co-authored the 250-
page report that paved the way for the repeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't 
Tell'' in 2010.
     Secretary Johnson's overall career has included extensive service 
in national security, law enforcement, and as an attorney in private 
corporate law practice. Secretary Johnson was General Counsel of the 
Department of the Air Force in 1998 to 2001, and he served as an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York in 1989 to 
1991.
    In private law practice, Secretary Johnson was a partner with the 
New York City-based law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and 
Garrison, LLP. In 2004, Secretary Johnson was elected a Fellow in the 
prestigious American College of Trial Lawyers, and he is a member of the 
Council on Foreign Relations.
    Secretary Johnson graduated from Morehouse College in 1979 and 
received his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1982.
