States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana and then for 
Judge Thomas Gibbs Gee of the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Fifth Circuit. Following his judicial clerkships, from 1986 until the 
end of the Reagan Administration on January 20, 1989, Judge Baker served 
in the Justice Department under Attorneys General Edwin Meese III and 
Richard Thornburgh, first as an attorney-advisor in the Office of Legal 
Policy, and later as a special assistant to the Assistant Attorney 
General for Civil Rights. Judge Baker then entered private practice in 
Washington, D.C., until 1991. From 1991 to 1993 he served as counsel to

Following his service on the Judiciary Committee staff, Judge Baker

of the Week'' for one of his Supreme Court wins. In addition to his 
appellate practice, Judge Baker litigated in state and federal trial 
courts in seventeen states and the District of Columbia. From 1986 to 
1995, Judge Baker served as a naval reserve intelligence officer and 
received an honorable discharge. His duties included serving with an 
anti-terrorist unit, on the battle staff of an admiral commanding a 
carrier battle group operating in the North Atlantic during a large NATO

Committees on constitutional and policy issues associated with
