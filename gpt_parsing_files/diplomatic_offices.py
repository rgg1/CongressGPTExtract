                    Extract diplomatic office information and representatives from this text into JSON format. Be thorough in extracting all relevant information (don't miss any names). For each diplomatic office:

                    1. Find the diplomatic office name (in ALL CAPS, e.g., "AFGHANISTAN", "ALBANIA", etc.)

                    2. For each diplomatic office section:
                    - Process everything until the next ALL CAPS office name appears
                    - Watch for office sections that continue across multiple pages

                    3. For each diplomatic office, extract:
                    - Primary representatives with official titles like:
                        * Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
                        * Chargé d'Affaires
                        * Minister
                        * Counselor
                        * First Secretary
                    - Look for standard prefixes/honorifics:
                        * His Excellency
                        * Her Excellency
                        * Mr.
                        * Ms.
                        * Dr.

                    4. Name processing rules:
                    - Look for names following honorifics
                    - Process both given names and surnames
                    - Handle compound names and special characters (accents, hyphens, etc.)
                    - Watch for names that may be split across lines
                    - Include middle names/initials when present

                    5. Role processing rules:
                    - Capture the complete official title
                    - If no explicit role is listed, use 'N/A'
                    - Include acting or temporary roles (e.g., "Chargé d'Affaires ad interim")
                    - Preserve the full diplomatic rank when provided

                    6. Country processing rules:
                    - Record the country associated with each representative
                    - Use the country name in ALL CAPS
                    - If the role isn't specific to a country, use 'N/A'

                    7. Special attention areas:
                    - Check for transitional or temporary appointments
                    - Watch for "Vacant" positions (if name is not provided just don't include the entry)
                    - Process names in consular office sections if they appear
                    - Handle cases where multiple representatives are listed (should each be a separate entry)
                    - Note when positions are filled by the same person (should each be a separate entry)

                    Important details:
                    - EVERY name that appears in the text must be included in the JSON
                    - Each diplomatic representative should be linked to their office
                    - Process ALL names even if they appear in subsidiary sections
                    - Maintain the connection between names and their diplomatic office
                    - Don't skip names just because they're in consular office sections
                    - Handle special cases like "protecting powers" listings at the end
                    - Check for continuation of titles/roles after page breaks
                    - Verify complete extraction when content spans page boundaries
                    - Process non-country diplomatic offices (e.g., African Union, European Union)
